# HMPPS Digital - Software Engineering 

### Thanks for your interest in software engineering at HMPPS Digital, this repository will take you through who we are, how we do things and how to apply for a role. 

Our software engineers are a member of multidisciplinary teams, they write code and operate software in either our Prison or Probation service areas.

They work with user researchers, product managers, designers, business analysts, delivery managers and content specialists who share a vision for **making better government through smarter use of technology**. 

We innovate to radically transform public services for the better.

<!-- ### Our software engineers are members of a community

We currently have over forty experienced developers who make up the broader engineering community, coach and mentor their colleagues and take part in informal support networks with their peers.

### Our architecture

- We favour distributed software architecture when building applications
- We use ‘right size’ services when designing our products and services

### Our standards

We maintain a number of tools to help set standards and enable teams to deliver value to users at pace, and are always looking for new ways to reduce sprint zero. Examples include:

- [Bootstrapping tool](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/dps-project-bootstrap) for creating new projects
- Template [Kotlin](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-template-kotlin) and [Typescript](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-template-typescript) GitHub repos for new services
- [CircleCI Orb](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-circleci-orb) to standardise our approach including security jobs
