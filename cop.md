# HMPPS Developer Community of Practice

## Introduction 

The HMPPS developer community of practice (or Dev CoP) is a weekly meeting for software engineers, technical architects, automation engineers, security experts, and other technical roles in HMPPS Digital.

They come together as technical professionals to share ideas, remove silos between teams, align practice, and talk technology. 

## How we organized the HMPPS Developer CoP

We use a Github project to track our ideas and organize the HMPPS developer community of practice. It's open to the public because we believe in working in the open. 

Below is a flowchart of how we use a combination of automation, transparency, and line management to encourage developers of all levels to give talks. 

For people who are not confident giving talks, we offer a support network of more experienced public speakers to help out.

## Security 

We care that the products and services we build are secure. This is why the MoJ Security team regularly take over the HMPPS developer community of practice to align our approach to cyber security

## Data 

We also have regular take-over sessions from the Data Strategy team to align our approach to data. 

## Examples Talks

To give you an idea of the types of talks, workshops, and events we run at HMPPS Digital we have linked a couple of examples below.
